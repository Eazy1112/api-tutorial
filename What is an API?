# What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows one application to interact with another. Think of it as a messenger that delivers requests and retrieves data between systems.

## Real-World Examples
- **Weather Apps:** Fetch weather data from external servers.
- **Maps:** Get directions from Google Maps' API.
- **Social Media:** Share content or retrieve posts using APIs like Twitter or Instagram.
